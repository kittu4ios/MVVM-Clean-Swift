**MVVM-Clean-Swift**

**MVVM-Clean-Swift** is a Swift-based iOS application that showcases the implementation of Clean Architecture combined with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. This sample app is designed to provide developers with a clear and practical example of how to apply these architectural principles in a real-world iOS project.

**Features**
1. **MVVM Design Pattern:** Separates business logic from UI components, enhancing code maintainability and testability.
2. **Clean Architecture:** Ensures a modular and scalable structure by clearly defining boundaries between different layers of the application.
3. **Swift Language:** Developed using modern Swift features and best practices.

**Purpose**
The goal of this project is to serve as an educational resource for developers interested in understanding and implementing Clean Architecture and MVVM in their iOS applications. It provides a practical example to help developers build more maintainable and testable code.
